# Anomaly detection via Time Series libraries
Python: sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, pandas. EDA methods first.

Test application of 1 proximity-based method (DBSCAN) and 1 reconstruction-based method (LSTM).
Calculation of f1, precision and recall for each method. Evaluating the quality of anomaly detection models without using real target values.
